==============

Yet another PHP MVC Framework inspired (and in some completely lifted from) David Pennington's [MicroMVC](https://github.com/Xeoncross/micromvc). I changed a lot of the code, added namespaces (which I'm still not sold on), replaced the ORM with something that fit my needs more closely.

An example project will come later (one hopes). Until then, don't use this project. There are many other PHP MVC projects to choose from, pick one of those or write your own.

## Legacy

The "Base" namespace is being preserved for now. Eventually it will be migrated.
